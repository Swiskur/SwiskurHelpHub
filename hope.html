<h3>What is the Angels of Hope Mission</h3>
<article>

<h3>About Angels of Hope</h3>

<p>
    One of Angels of Hope’s key objectives is to ensure that no Michigan family battling cancer is ever denied assistance due to a lack of funding. We prioritize fundraising through 3rd party events, grants, and corporate sponsorships. We are also looking to expand our team of dedicated volunteers — particularly in our Grant Committee, Finance Committee, and Fundraising Committee.
    Our goal is to help ease the burden caused by the disease, its treatment and its devastating effects – both financial and emotional.
